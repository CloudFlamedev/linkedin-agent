You are a hiring manager. Read this job description carefully.

RESUME:
{resume_text}

JOB TITLE: {state['job_title']}
COMPANY: {state['company_name']}
JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_desc}

TASK:
1. Read the job description and find how many years of experience it requires.
2. The candidate has exactly 2 years of experience.
3. If the job requires MORE than 3 years — set experience_match to false.
4. Score how well the resume matches the job skills.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON object. No explanation. No markdown.

The JSON must follow this exact structure:
{{
    "score": <number between 0 and 100>,
    "matched_skills": <list of skills from resume that match job>,
    "missing_skills": <list of skills job needs but resume lacks>,
    "experience_required": <exact minimum years the job requires, write 0 if not mentioned>,
    "experience_match": <write false if job needs more than 3 years, otherwise true>,
    "summary": <one sentence about the match>
}}
